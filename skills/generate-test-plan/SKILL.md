description: >-
  Generate a structured test plan when the user asks to "create a test plan", "write test cases",
  "generate QA scenarios", "prepare a testing checklist", "identify what to test", "find edge cases",
  "plan testing coverage", "document test scenarios", "create a QA handoff document", "what should
  I test?", "what are the edge cases?", or "how would you test this?". Also use when the user
  describes requirements or acceptance criteria and asks how to verify them, or wants to plan testing
  before actually running tests. Produces a structured, prioritized test plan document saved to
  docs/testplans/ with risk analysis, coverage matrix, automation candidates, and proper TC format.
  Do NOT trigger when: the user wants automated unit/integration tests written in code
  (use write-tests), or the user wants to run an existing test plan. Never launches an app,
  device, or browser — only produces a document.

# Generate Test Plan

Analyze a feature from its specification, design, or implementation and produce a structured,
prioritized test plan as a markdown document. No tests are executed — the output is a plan ready
for `write-tests` / an engineer to implement as unit / integration tests later.

**Scope:** plans **L2 unit / integration tests only** (no device). Instrumented UI, screenshot/visual, E2E, and manual runtime testing are out of scope — see `~/.claude/rules/qa-and-testing.md` § Verification pyramid.

## Output

Save every test plan to the repository:

```
docs/testplans/<slug>-test-plan.md
```

Create the `docs/testplans/` directory if it doesn't exist. The slug is the canonical
filename anchor — `acceptance` mounts by exact slug match, so the filename must be
slug-based regardless of invocation mode.

Slug resolution rules (apply in order):

1. **Caller-provided** — when a `slug` argument is passed explicitly, use it as-is.
2. **Standalone invocation, slug provided inline** — the user may supply a slug
   directly (e.g. `"slug: login-flow"`). Use it as-is.
3. **Standalone invocation, no slug** — derive one from the feature name with the
   stable kebab-case convention used elsewhere: lowercase the name, replace runs
   of spaces or punctuation with `-`, trim leading/trailing `-`.

Examples of derivation (rule 3): `"User authentication"` → `user-authentication`,
`"Cart & checkout"` → `cart-checkout`, `"Token refresh (auth)"` → `token-refresh-auth`.
The resulting filename is then `docs/testplans/<slug>-test-plan.md` (for example,
`docs/testplans/user-authentication-test-plan.md`).

### Receipt (when invoked with a slug)

When invoked with a `slug` argument, also emit a receipt at
`swarm-report/<slug>-test-plan.md` so `multiexpert-review` and `acceptance` can mount
the artifact via receipt-based gating. The permanent file remains the source of truth;
the receipt is metadata + pointer. Standalone invocations (no slug passed) skip the
receipt entirely and write only the canonical `docs/testplans/<slug>-test-plan.md` file.

See [`references/receipt-format.md`](references/receipt-format.md) for the full YAML schema, field conventions
(`status`, `review_verdict`, `review_warnings` / `review_blockers`, `phase_coverage`,
`platform`, `created` / `updated`), and the standalone-without-slug backward-compatibility
rules.

## Input Discovery

Sources may be a text spec (PRD / AC / user story) or existing code — often a combination. Cross-reference them; flag spec/code discrepancies as a finding, mark behaviour inferred from code alone with `[inferred from code]`.

**Spec frontmatter.** When the source is a file with YAML frontmatter and contains a `platform:` list, copy it verbatim into the receipt's `platform:` field (canonical values: `android | ios | web | desktop | backend-jvm | backend-node | cli | library | generic`, same as `write-spec`). Otherwise leave `platform:` empty in the receipt — `acceptance` falls back to its project-type heuristic.

### Test-plan shape

Plans describe pure-logic / API behaviour — see `~/.claude/rules/qa-and-testing.md` § 3. Produce TCs whose behaviour is fully captured by Given/When/Then — focus on input validation, state transitions, and error paths.

## Test Plan Format

Every generated test plan has the same top-level layout: YAML frontmatter with `type: test-plan`
and `slug`, a header metadata table, then `Findings`, `Risk Areas`, `Test Cases`,
`Edge Cases & Negative Scenarios`, `Coverage Matrix`, and `Suggested Automation Candidates`.
Each `TC-[N]` block is itself a table with `Priority`, `Tier`, `Preconditions`, `Steps`,
`Expected Result`, and `Source` rows.

Two variants exist:

- **Standard format** — the default; full Steps + Expected Result columns.
- **Lightweight format (non-UI features)** — when the non-UI detector triggers, TC blocks
  collapse Steps and Expected Result into a single `Scenario (Given/When/Then)` row.
  All other sections are unchanged.

When the feature has two or more phases (e.g. a multi-stage rollout) and test cases can
be grouped by phase, split the `## Test Cases` section into `### Phase N (T-i..T-j) — <label>`
subsections (still one permanent file per feature). The receipt's `phase_coverage` then lists
the phase labels present.

See [`references/format-templates.md`](references/format-templates.md) for the full standard and lightweight templates (verbatim
markdown), the phase-segmentation worked example, and the rules for when each variant applies.

## Field Definitions

### Type

Every test case declares an explicit `Type` plus a one-line `Type rationale` (see `references/format-templates.md`). Downstream consumers (`finalize` Phase D coverage audit, `multiexpert-review` test-plan profile, engineer agents writing the actual tests) read this field — it is not optional.

| Type | Scope | Pick when |
|------|-------|-----------|
| `unit` | One class/function with mocked collaborators | Pure logic, transform, validator, mapper, parser, state-holder math |
| `integration` | Several classes plus real / in-memory dependencies | Repository + DB, service + test API, data pipeline, multi-class interaction |

Device-dependent types (instrumented UI, screenshot/visual, E2E) are **out of scope** — never planned.

#### Selection heuristic

Per acceptance criterion: pick the **smallest scope that catches a real failure of that AC**. Climb only when needed. When in doubt, prefer the cheaper type.

| AC shape | Type |
|---|---|
| Value transform / pure computation | `unit` |
| Component interaction with real or fake collaborators | `integration` |
| Only verifiable by driving the running app / UI | out of scope — note in Findings, do not plan a device test |

This heuristic is the canonical reference for picking a TC type within this plugin family.

### Priority

Priority framework — see `~/.claude/rules/qa-and-testing.md` § 2.

### Tier

| Tier | Meaning | Guideline |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Smoke** | Is it alive? | Minimum set to confirm the feature works at all (3-5 tests max) |
| **Feature** | Does it work correctly? | Thorough coverage of the feature's behavior |
| **Regression** | Did we break anything? | Guards against breaking existing functionality |

### Source

| Source type | Format | Example |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Spec section | `Spec §[section]` | `Spec §3.2 — Login flow` |
| Figma frame | `Figma: [frame name]` | `Figma: Login / Error State` |
| Code path | backtick-wrapped path with line | `src/auth/LoginViewModel.kt:87` |
| Inferred | `[inferred from code]` | Behavior derived from code with no spec backing |

### Non-functional / Instrumentation (mandatory for user-facing / prod-bound)

Every plan ends with a `## Non-functional / Instrumentation` section that declares observability **before** implementation, not after the first incident. Required when the spec / task is tagged `user-facing` or `prod-bound`, or when the feature touches an observability hot-path: network calls, payments, background jobs, auth, data migrations.

`N/A: <reason>` (one line) is allowed for internal / developer-only tooling and for pure refactors with no change to observable behavior. Never delete the heading.

The section covers five subsections — Log events / Metrics / Traces / Alerts / Dashboards (full template in [`references/format-templates.md`](references/format-templates.md#non-functional--instrumentation)). The skill reads naming and stack conventions (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, StatsD, vendor-specific) from the project's `CLAUDE.md` and reuses them; it does not prescribe a stack. If the project has no convention, the skill asks one question and records the answer.

Downstream stages consume this section:

- `multiexpert-review` test-plan profile checks the section is filled or carries an explicit `N/A: <reason>`.

## Guidelines

- Number test cases sequentially: TC-1, TC-2, TC-3 ...
- Each test case asserts exactly one thing — split multi-outcome verifications.
- Mark inferred behaviour with `[inferred from code]`.
- Target 15-30 test cases for a medium feature; every TC must earn its place.
