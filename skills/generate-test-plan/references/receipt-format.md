# Test Plan Receipt Format

When this skill is invoked with an explicit `slug` argument, in addition to the permanent
document, produce a **receipt** at `swarm-report/<slug>-test-plan.md` that downstream
consumers (`multiexpert-review`, `acceptance`) can read for receipt-based gating.

The permanent file remains the source of truth. The receipt is metadata + pointer.

Receipt format:

```markdown
---
name: test-plan-receipt
description: Test plan artifact for <slug>
slug: <slug>
type: test-plan-receipt
status: Draft
permanent_path: docs/testplans/<slug>-test-plan.md
source_spec: <path to spec if any, or "inline spec">
review_verdict: pending
review_warnings: []            # populated by multiexpert-review on WARN — list of short strings
review_blockers: []            # populated by multiexpert-review on FAIL — list of short strings
phase_coverage: [Phase 1, Phase 2, ...]
platform: []                   # optional; inherited from the source spec's `platform:` field when present.
                               # Drives platform-aware TC generation and downstream acceptance checks (e.g.,
                               # skip mobile-only TCs on a backend-only target). Leave empty when the spec
                               # did not set it; acceptance falls back to its project-type heuristic.
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD

# Test Plan Receipt: <slug>

**Status:** <status>
**Permanent artifact:** [`docs/testplans/<slug>-test-plan.md`](../docs/testplans/<slug>-test-plan.md)
**Source spec:** <path or description>
**Review verdict:** <verdict>
```

## Field conventions

- `status`: `Draft` right after generation; `Ready` after multiexpert-review returns PASS/WARN;
  `Approved` when the user explicitly signs off; `Mounted` when a user-authored permanent
  file is adopted without regeneration.
- `review_verdict`: `pending` at creation; updated by `multiexpert-review` to
  `PASS | WARN | FAIL`; `skipped` on mount (no review occurs).
- `review_warnings` / `review_blockers`: arrays of short strings populated by `multiexpert-review`.
  `review_warnings` is written on WARN verdicts (items d or e of the checklist violated —
  non-blocking); `review_blockers` is written on FAIL (items a, b, or c violated —
  blocks transition to Implement). Both remain empty arrays on PASS / pending / skipped.
  Frontmatter is the single source of truth for review findings — the receipt body does
  not re-list them, keeping downstream YAML parsers authoritative.
- `phase_coverage`: list of phase labels present in the permanent file. Empty list if the
  feature has no phase segmentation.
- `created` / `updated`: ISO dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`). `updated` must change whenever either the
  permanent file or any receipt field is modified.
- Relative path in the markdown link assumes the conventional `swarm-report/` ↔ `docs/`
  sibling layout at the repo root.

## Standalone invocation without slug

When a user invokes this skill directly (e.g. "create a test plan for X") without an
explicit `slug`, the receipt is **not** produced. The permanent file is still saved
under the canonical slug-based filename:

- Permanent file generated at `docs/testplans/<slug>-test-plan.md`, where `<slug>` is
  either provided inline or derived from the feature name per the Slug resolution rules
  in SKILL.md. If the plan may later be consumed by `acceptance` (Branch 2 mount), pick
  the eventual slug at creation time so the file is deterministically mountable without
  renaming.
- No `swarm-report/<slug>-test-plan.md` receipt is written.
- No `phase_coverage` or receipt metadata tracked elsewhere.

Standalone callers continue to work: the slug-based filename is the single canonical
artifact. Pre-existing `docs/testplans/*-test-plan.md` files authored before this
convention are not auto-migrated — they remain readable by humans, but mount logic
matches only on the exact `<slug>-test-plan.md` path.
