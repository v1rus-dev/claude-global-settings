## Context and Motivation

{2-4 sentences: what this feature does, who benefits, why now.
Write the "why" that will still make sense in 6 months.}

## Acceptance Criteria

The feature is complete when ALL of the following are true. Each criterion is assigned a
stable `AC-N` id. The frontmatter `acceptance_criteria_ids` list is **optional** for
back-compat, but when it is provided, it MUST include every `AC-N` id listed here and nothing
else; that is what `acceptance` uses to drive AC-coverage checks via `business-analyst`.
Leaving `acceptance_criteria_ids` empty disables the business-analyst conditional.

- [ ] **AC-1** — {Concrete, observable behavior — not internal state}
- [ ] **AC-2** — {Another criterion}
- [ ] **AC-3** — {Error / edge case criterion}
- [ ] **AC-4** — {Performance criterion with specific numbers, if relevant}
- [ ] **AC-5** — {Compatibility criterion, if relevant}

**Authoritative definition of done.** The implementing agent validates against this
list before marking any task complete.

## Prerequisites

Steps that must be completed BEFORE implementation begins. Each item is either
already done, or is an explicit task for the implementing agent or a human.

| Prerequisite | Status | Owner | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|-------|
| {e.g., Create FCM project in Firebase console} | ⬜ Todo / ✅ Done | Human / Agent | {how to do it} |
| {e.g., Add notification entitlement to app} | ⬜ Todo | Agent | {file to modify} |

*(Remove this section if there are no prerequisites outside of code changes.)*

## Affected Modules and Files

| Module / File | Change type | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| {path or module name} | New / Modified / Deleted | {what changes and why} |

Key integration points:
- {Interface or class that new code must implement or call}
- {Existing service or repository that will be extended}

## Technical Approach

{High-level description of HOW the feature will be implemented — not code, but enough
to guide architecture:
- Which pattern to follow (existing or new)
- Data flow: source → transformation → destination
- Key new abstractions (classes, interfaces, modules)
- Error handling strategy
- State management approach (if UI-relevant)}

## Technical Constraints

Rules the implementing agent must follow without deviation:

- {Must use X library — already in project}
- {Must NOT add new dependencies without approval}
- {Must follow Y pattern used elsewhere}
- {Must support API level Z+}
- {Must be KMP-compatible / Android-only}
- {No blocking operations on the main thread}

## Decisions Made

Choices locked in during spec. The implementing agent does NOT revisit these.

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| {What was decided} | {The choice} | {Why this over alternatives} |

## Out of Scope

Will NOT be implemented as part of this spec:

- {Behavior or feature explicitly excluded}
- {Edge case deferred to a future spec} *(owner: {team/person}, target: {Phase N / separate spec})*
- {Migration or compatibility concern left out}

## Open Questions

Unresolved questions the implementing agent must handle or escalate:

- [ ] {Question} — *blocking / non-blocking*
  - Options: {A}, {B}
  - Recommendation: {preferred}

If none: write "None — spec is complete." and remove this section.

## Future Phases

*(Only when feature was split into phases)*

**Phase 2 — {name}:** {brief description, why deferred}
**Phase 3 — {name}:** {brief description}

Specced separately after Phase 1 is implemented and validated in production.
