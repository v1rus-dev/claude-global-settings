# Plan templates

Copy each block verbatim into the matching file under `docs/plans/<slug>/` and fill every
placeholder. Three files, split by lifetime: `plan.md` and `tasks.md` are the stable design;
`progress.md` is the volatile execution ledger (Cline-style split — execution churn must never
rewrite the design).

## `docs/plans/<slug>/plan.md`

```markdown

type: plan
slug: <kebab-case>
date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
status: draft           # draft → approved (set by Phase 4 on PASS/CONDITIONAL); stays draft on escalate (review_verdict carries escalate, not this field)
spec: docs/specs/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md    # real path if a spec exists (date is the spec's own date, format matches write-spec output); if no spec exists, write: none — do NOT invent a path
risk_areas: []          # subset of [auth, payment, pii, data-migration, perf-critical] — advisory only; reviewer selection is driven by the plan's prose (Technical Approach / Risks), so risks must also be described there for the matching expert (e.g. security-expert) to be triggered
review_verdict: pending # pending → pass | conditional | escalate (set by Phase 3)
review_blockers: []     # filled by the review loop when blockers remain

# Plan: <title>

## Context & Decision
<2–4 sentences: what is being built and why it is already decided. Link the spec / research /
request that decided it. This plan is the HOW, not the WHAT — do not re-argue scope here.>

## Technical Approach
<The concrete design. Architecture, data flow, key types/interfaces, the integration points in the
existing codebase (cite file:line from investigation). Enough that an implementing agent does not
need to re-research.>

## Affected Modules & Files
| Path | Change | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `<path>` | New / Modified / Renamed / Deleted | <what changes and why> |

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale | Alternatives rejected |
|---|---|---|
| <what we chose> | <because…> | <X because…> |

## Dependencies
<!-- Only if this change ADDS or BUMPS a dependency / plugin. The dependencies.md plan-stage gate —
     a plan that introduces a library without these four outputs is not approvable. Delete this whole
     section if no dependency changes. -->
For each new / bumped dependency:
- **Identity:** `<group:artifact>` (or plugin id) — role in one line, why existing deps don't cover it.
- **Freshness:** latest stable `X.Y.Z` (via `maven-mcp:latest-version` / ecosystem scanner). Note any pre-release gap.
- **Vulnerabilities:** `maven-mcp:check-deps-vulnerabilities` (or `npm audit` / `pip-audit` / …) — advisory IDs + fixed-in, or "no advisories".
- **API surface:** studied via `ksrc` / Context7 / official docs — entry points used, confirmed against the **current** API. For a major-version bump add the breaking-change diff.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| <risk> | critical / major / minor | <how the plan handles it> |

## Verification & Sources
<How the FINISHED implementation is verified — the contract `/acceptance` checks against. Distinct
from the per-task `check` in tasks.md: that proves each task; this proves the whole change is done
and correct. Mandatory output — a plan without it cannot be approved (qa-and-testing §6, §0).>

| Source of truth | Type | Status | Sufficient for verification? |
|---|---|---|---|
| <path / link / "baseline captured at swarm-report/<slug>-baseline.md"> | spec / test-plan / requirements / before-state baseline / Figma-or-screenshots / debug-repro | present / to-capture-before-impl / absent | yes — <why it lets someone who's never seen the system confirm "done"> / no — <gap + how it's closed before implementation> |

**Complexity score (1–10):** <N> — band: <build-only (1–6) | tested (7–8) | critical (9–10)>
(qa-and-testing §0). The user confirms or overrides this at the gate.

**Testing strategy (pyramid levels):** L0 build always + <levels that apply: L1 static, L2 unit /
integration> — <one line: why these levels for this change>. The ladder tops out at L2. Tests are
written only from complexity 7 (qa-and-testing §0); below that, verification is build + static
analysis + the quality gate — no tests. If a level the routing matrix marks mandatory is skipped,
name it and the tracked exception (qa-and-testing §1/§4) — never a silent skip.

> The frontmatter `spec:` field carries only the spec link for tooling; this section is the full,
> human-readable verification contract — list every source, not just the spec. For a bug fix the
> source is `swarm-report/<slug>-debug.md`; for a migration / "shouldn't change behavior" task it is
> the before-state baseline, captured **before** any edit (task-types § Before-state baseline).

## Out of Scope
- <explicitly NOT done by this plan, with owner / deferral target if relevant>

## Open Questions
- [blocking] <question that must be answered before / during implementation>
- [non-blocking] <question that can be resolved while implementing>
```

## `docs/plans/<slug>/tasks.md`

Ordered, dependency-aware checklist. Each task is small enough to implement AND verify in one
focused pass, and carries an acceptance condition that is checkable without human judgement — this
is what makes autonomous execution safe.

```markdown
# Tasks: <title>

> Plan: ./plan.md · Spec AC referenced inline as AC-N

## T-1 — <short title>
- after: none
- files: `<path>`, `<path>`
- acceptance: GIVEN <precondition> WHEN <action> THEN <observable result>   (or: THE SYSTEM SHALL <…>)
- check: <test name / grep / build target that proves acceptance>   (satisfies AC-1)

## T-2 — <short title>
- after: T-1
- files: `<path>`
- acceptance: <Given/When/Then or SHALL statement>
- check: <how it is verified>   (satisfies AC-2, AC-3)
```

Acceptance phrasing: prefer Given/When/Then for behaviour, "THE SYSTEM SHALL …" (EARS) for
invariants/constraints. Always pair acceptance with a concrete `check` — a test name, a grep, a
build/lint target — never "looks right".

---

## `docs/plans/<slug>/progress.md`

Initialize with one unchecked box per task and an empty learnings log. The implementer updates this
as work proceeds; it carries state across sessions and fresh-context runs (so a stop/resume or an
autonomous loop never loses its place).

```markdown
# Progress: <title>

> Plan: ./plan.md · Tasks: ./tasks.md

## Status
- [ ] T-1 — <short title>
- [ ] T-2 — <short title>

## Learnings
<!-- Append one line per completed task: surprises, gotchas, decisions taken during implementation.
     This is the memory that survives context resets. -->
```
